This PowerShell function is designed to manage AD User ID


To execute the funcation correctly, first, open PowerShell with administrative privileges, often referred to as "elevated mode." Then, input the command:

'Import-Module Get-ADUserID.ps1'

After successfully importing the module, you can run the function by typing `Get-ADID`. This command should present you with a menu that includes options:
1. Get ID Status
2. Unlock the ID (If the User ID is currently locked)
3. Exit
  
It's important to ensure that the script `Get-ADUserID.ps1` is located in the correct directory and that you have the necessary permissions to execute it. 

Always remember to follow your organization's policies and guidelines when performing administrative tasks in PowerShell.
