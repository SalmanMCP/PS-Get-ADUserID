This PowerShell function is designed to manage AD User ID


To execute the funcation correctly, first, open PowerShell with administrative privileges, often referred to as "elevated mode." Then, input the command:

Import-Module Get-ADUserID.ps1

to import the necessary module. After successfully importing the module, you can run the function by typing `Get-ADID`. This command should present you with a menu that includes options such as "Get ID Status," "Unlock the ID," and "Exit." To proceed with checking the status of an Active Directory User ID, you would press '1'. It's important to ensure that the script `Get-ADUserID.ps1` is located in the correct directory and that you have the necessary permissions to execute it. Always remember to follow your organization's policies and guidelines when performing administrative tasks in PowerShell.
